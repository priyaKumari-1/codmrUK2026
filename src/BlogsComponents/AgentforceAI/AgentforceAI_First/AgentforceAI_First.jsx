                                        The Agentforce Vibe Coding a Lead Hub - AgentForce in Action demonstrates how Salesforce's Agentforce Vibes, an AI powered development tool, is changing the way applications are built within Salesforce. Instead of relying on traditional manual coding, the tool uses natural language instructions to create fully functional apps and components.Agentforce generates a complete Lead Hub application from a single command, showing how quickly and efficiently complex business solutions can be developed when AI understands the business context and data structure. Rather than navigating multiple setup screens or writing code step by step, the presenter simply explains the desired features of a lead management hub, and Agentforce interprets those requirements to build a working application with real data and workflows. Overall, the demonstration highlights the future of AI assisted software development, where users can create applications by describing what they need instead of focusing on how to build them.
